# just a placeholder - no python code here

# TODO - there is a few things that need to add into this directory
# Always use official numbered release as a source https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/archive/refs/tags/v1.4.0.tar.gz
#
# Based on snapcraft I would say we should copy
# the files/directories named below (https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L20):
#
# - vnc.html
# - app/
# - core/
# - vendor/
# - utils/
#
# Remember to copy directories with all their content
#
# TODO - once we have files in place we need to register them in MANIFEST.IN
#
# TODO - we need to patch one specific js file to make websockify in under uri (remind me on this one)
